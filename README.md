## Saarthi - Where curiosity meets clarity
![logo](Logo_Saarthi.jpeg)

**Saarthi** is an AI-driven centralized platform designed to foster curiosity by delivering clear, precise, and actionable insights. Whether addressing complex queries or solving image-based and text-based problems, Saarthi ensures seamless support for diverse challenges. Its intuitive approach and user-focused design empower learners and professionals alike to explore, understand, and solve problems effortlessly, making learning and discovery more accessible than ever.

## **Project Overview**

### **Empowering Every Curious Mind: Bridging Learning Gaps with Innovation**
In today’s education landscape, many students face significant challenges due to a **lack of quality teaching**, **limited resources**, or **inaccessible guidance**. **Saarthi** aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive, **AI-driven web application** designed **to foster curiosity and support students eager to learn** despite their circumstances.
Our platform acts as a **learning backbone** for underserved and underprivileged students, enabling them to resolve their doubts through both text-based and image-based queries. Whether students scan a question or type their query, **Saarthi** delivers clear, accurate solutions, fostering a deeper understanding and encouraging continuous learning.

### **Inspiration**
The inspiration behind this project stems from the challenges faced by underserved and underprivileged students who, despite their curiosity and eagerness to learn, are often restricted by poor-quality education, limited resources, and a lack of adequate guidance. These barriers leave many of their questions unresolved, dampening their potential and hindering their future opportunities.  
**Our vision** is to create a **platform** that serves as a **vital academic backbone** for such learners, offering easy and accessible solutions to resolve their doubts—whether text-based or image-based. By harnessing the power of technology, we aim to empower students to explore, learn, and grow, no matter the circumstances of their environment.

### **Key Features of the Project**  

1. **Text and Image-Based Query Resolution**  
   Students can submit questions as text or by uploading images. The platform instantly resolves their queries, helping them understand concepts effectively and independently.

2. **Gamified Learning Activities**  
   Interactive learning tools like quizzes and flashcards are generated based on student-selected topics, promoting curiosity and engagement in a fun, competitive environment.

3. **Comprehensive Educational Resources**  
   A wide range of learning materials across subjects enables underserved students to strengthen their knowledge and critical thinking skills.

4. **Emergency Medical Guidance(SOS)**  
   Step-by-step instructions for handling emergency conditions like heart attacks, snake bites, burns, or low blood pressure, curated by qualified medical professionals.

5. **Feedback Collection**  
   Students can provide feedback on their learning experience, helping the platform improve and better meet their educational needs.

6. **Progress Tracker**  
   A built-in feature that displays progress tracking for students to monitor their quiz performance and learning milestones.

7. **Accessible and User-Friendly Interface**  
   Designed for ease of use, the platform ensures learners of all backgrounds can navigate resources seamlessly.

8. **Minimal Cost and Easy Access**  
   Affordable and inclusive, the platform removes financial and technical barriers to ensure quality education is available to all curious learners.

## **Technologies & Tools Used -**

- **Frontend**: CSS, JavaScript, ejs  
- **Backend**: NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB Atlas,Vector DB, Flask API
- **AI Tools**: Plotch.ai, Groclake, Gemini API, Clovinary
- **Framework**: Bootstrap
- **Deployment**: Render       
- **Other Tools**: Libraries, Python

### **Challenges We Faced**

1. **Creation of a Vector Database for Project Features**:  
   Implementing a vector database to store and retrieve large volumes of contextual information efficiently posed a significant challenge. Designing a structure that ensured rapid, accurate data retrieval for dynamic features such as quiz generation and flashcard creation required extensive planning and optimization.

2. **Integration of Plotch.ai with the Project**:  
   Integrating **Plotch.ai** into the platform presented compatibility and functionality challenges. Ensuring seamless communication between Plotch.ai and the project components required meticulous testing and fine-tuning to maintain performance and accuracy.

3. **Cross-Language Integration Challenges**:  
   Since **Plotch.ai** primarily supports Python rather than JavaScript, we faced a major challenge in bridging the gap between the backend services and frontend web application. To overcome this, we first developed a **Flask API** to handle Plotch.ai functionalities and then connected it to our **Node.js server**, ensuring smooth communication with the web page.

Despite these technical obstacles, we successfully delivered a fully functional, innovative learning platform by leveraging creative solutions, robust testing, and teamwork.
